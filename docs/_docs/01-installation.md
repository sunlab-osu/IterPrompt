It's a good idea to always use virtual environments when working with Python packages.
Anaconda/Miniconda is a package manager that lets you create virtual environments and manage package installations smoothly.

Follow the instructions given below to install Simple Transformers using with Anaconda (or miniconda, a lighter version of anaconda).

## Installation steps

1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda Package Manager from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
2. Create a new virtual environment and install packages.
   ```shell
   conda create -n st python pandas tqdm
   conda activate st
   ```
3. Using a CUDA capable GPU is recommended.
   To install Pytorch with CUDA support:
   ```shell
   conda install pytorch>=1.6 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
   ```
   CPU only:
   ```shell
   conda install pytorch cpuonly -c pytorch
   ```

4. Install simpletransformers.
`pip install simpletransformers`

## Optional

1. Install Weights and Biases (wandb) for experiment tracking and visualizing training in a web browser.
`pip install wandb`
